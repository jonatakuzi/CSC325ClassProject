# User Personas Directory

## 📂 Purpose
The `user_personas` directory is designated to store user personas for the project. User personas are fictional representations of typical users based on data, research, and insights. These personas help software developers, designers, and stakeholders better understand the needs, behaviors, and goals of the users who will interact with the product.

## 🧑‍💻 Intended Use
The personas stored in this directory should be referred to during the development process to ensure the product aligns with the needs and expectations of its intended audience. By utilizing these personas, the project team can:

- Gain deeper insights into the goals and pain points of users.
- Make informed decisions about features, user interfaces, and functionality.
- Create user-centered designs that cater to the diverse needs of the target audience.
- Improve collaboration across the team by providing a shared understanding of user needs.

## 📄 Structure
Each persona will be stored in an individual file, and the files will be named according to the persona's type (e.g., `persona_developer.md`, `persona_manager.md`, etc.). Each persona document will contain key details, such as:

- **Name** (Fictional name for reference)
- **Demographics** (Age, job title, education, etc.)
- **Goals** (What the user hopes to achieve)
- **Challenges** (Pain points or obstacles the user faces)
- **Behavior patterns** (How the user interacts with the product)
- **Needs and expectations** (Specific features or outcomes the user expects)

## 📝 How to Add or Edit a Persona
If you would like to add or update a persona, please follow this process:

1. Create a new `.md` file with a descriptive name.
2. Include all relevant information in a consistent format.
3. Review the persona for clarity, accuracy, and relevance.
4. Submit a pull request with your changes.

By maintaining up-to-date and detailed personas, we ensure that our development efforts are always grounded in real user needs.
